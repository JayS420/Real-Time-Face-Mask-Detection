# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection
I had built a Real-Time Face Mask Detection using Keras, Tensorflow, Keras, MobileNet, and OpenCV. I have also applied this on Live Video Camera. With further improvements, this type of model could be integrated with a CCTV camera to detect and identify people without masks.

The model is accurate, and since MobileNetV2 architecture is used, it is also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to an embedded system. (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications that require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for applications in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that safety guidelance are followed.
