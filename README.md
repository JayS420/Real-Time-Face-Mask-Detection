# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection
I have build a Real Time Face Mask Detection using Keras, Tensorflow, Keras, MobileNet and OpenCV. I have also applied this on Live Vedio Camera. With further improvements this type of models could be intergrated with CCTV camera to detect and identify people without masks.

The model is accurate, and since MobileNetV2 architecture is used, it is also computaionally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded system. (Respberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for applications in airport, railway stations, officies, school and public places to ensure that safety guidelance are followed.
